# iOS and Android Applications with Flutter
I have recently started wirking with Flutter and am enjoying the framework more than any I've used so far! 
I created this repository to make as many projects as I can to improve on my Development and UI/UX skills! I will keep adding introductions and procedures as well as reflections on each project I make. I will also make sure that most of my code is well commented so that people can understand what's going on at each step! 

## Crypto Currency Price Tracker
This is a simple and responsive mobile application which displays the current prices of the top crypto currencies. The data for the prices and cryptocurrencies is taken from [cryptocompare's](https://www.cryptocompare.com) public API. The highlight of this applcation is that I experimented with Bloc State Management instead of the traditional Model-View-Controller pattern. Bloc is different in that it acts as a central unit for sending signals to different widgets as needed by using streams of events. You don't need to download a new library for Bloc, it comes within the flutter packages.
